        <section class="autobio-box">
            <p>I was born in 2004, and the place is called Bamboo, or, in simple words, "Cauayan City." I did not remember much back then, but my mom told me that I was a stubborn, active, and adorable child. I like chocolate more than milk. I always fall into bed and bump underneath the bed.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Since I first started going to school, I have met many friends. During break time with my friends, we played many games of marble, text, running, basketball, and even climbing in a tree. Unfortunately, I was diagnosed with appendicitis at the very young age of 10 years old. I thought that was my last time. I and my family were suffering financially, and my parents did their best for my operation. Their sacrifices mean a lot to me, and I am thankful and lucky to have them.</p>
            <br>
            <p>My high school days were also fun. I had met another friend and had my first crush. Every year that goes by, I become more mature. I don't know my path yet; my goal at the time was to get into class rank. Not to brag, but I am an honor student in my high school.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I am currently in my third year of college. I have two more years to get my degree in BSIT, hopefully. Some of my friends from childhood until now are still there, but there is no communication; each of us got busy with our own lives. As I grow older, I understand more things than before, and my mind becomes more open to learning. I know my path now, so I just set my goal to achieve that. This is not the end, but this is the beginning of my journey.</p>
